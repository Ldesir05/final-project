# Instructions for Running my Project


Hello fellow classmates made my project code very simple to run. things required for running my code :

# 1: Please make sure you have selenium,time,os and openyxl installed. If not, on windows run a command prompt and install using pip install selenium then hit enter etc.Hopefully by now you should have selenium and openpyxl. On mac run terminal and do the same.. 

# 2: Make sure you have have firefox installed on your computer because it going to utilize this browser to download the file.

# 3: Double click on Finalproject.py file then run the code.

# 4: Vola, It will open up firefox download the file and then the magic begins.

# 5: I have placed a folder name sample in there contains two files sprint1.xlsx which contains the raw file before the code runs and results.xlsx is the result are the code is  completed.

# 6: what i have noticed when running my code on a windows platform is that i had to adjust the sleep time giving the computer enough time to download the file. if you are on a slow computer you might want to change the line time.sleep(4) to time.sleep(6). I have it at default to wait 4 seconds before closing the browser.
