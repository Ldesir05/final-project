#I wanted to create a program that grabs a document from the web spreadsheet from a portal
#What inspired this well i have been edditing spreadsheets and wanted a way to make this easy
#I created the spreadsheet and populated the sheet with names numbers usage costs etc.
# I then upload the created spreadsheet on a shared portal(google drive).
#So this code open the webbroswer using firefox then navigates to the shared file thats is google drive
#downloads the file, saves that file in the current working directory. Where the code is runned.
#The browser is kept open for 4 seconds giving the file enought time to download.
#the spread sheet is opened
#Then the sheet is called
#A new workbook is created
#A new sheet is created in that new workbook
#the code loops through the first colunm (colunm 0) and gets all the information in the first colunm
#It does the same thing for the second and the last colunm in the active sheet
#All the information for that was gathered from the sprint1 spreed sheet is now placed on the new spreadsheet
#in the new sheet,The new workbook is now saved in the current directory with the name results
