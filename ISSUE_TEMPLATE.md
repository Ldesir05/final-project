Limbert Desir Final Project.

### Name

Limbert Desir.

### Proposed Project Description

For my Final project, at work i am left with the boring task of editing a xlsx file. Which is downloaded from a Sprint portal. Then i have to edit all the files on that sheet or clean up and the final result ending with three columns. First column is the phone numbers, Second column is the names and the Third column is the total charge for the month.I plan on writing a script to open a browser. Navigate to through the portal, Download the xlsx file. Grab the information and create a new Excel file with the final results.

### Connecting Concepts
What chapters/topics will this project allow you to practice? A good final project will cover at least 2 distinct topics from class. 

I plan on using the chapter 11,12 and 14 to help me accomplish this

### Timing
How long do you think this project will take to implement? Feel free to give a brief timeline of tasks you'd like to accomplish with dates.

i believe that this would take me a week to complete or completed on the 26th or no later than the 27th.

### Asking for...
What kind of feedback can your classmates and professor provide to help you be successful?

Any feedback would be great, I am putting myself to the challenge.
